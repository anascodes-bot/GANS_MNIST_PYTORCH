# GANS_MNIST_PYTORCH

The provided code implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch. GANs consist of two parts: a generator and a discriminator, which compete to improve their performance. The code begins by importing required libraries and setting up data preprocessing. It loads the MNIST dataset, shows an example image, and prepares data for training. A helper function for displaying images is defined. The architecture of the discriminator and generator networks is created using convolutional layers. Weight initialization and loss functions are specified. Adam optimizers are chosen for updating the networks. The main training loop runs for a specified number of epochs. Within each epoch, the discriminator and generator are alternatively updated using real and generated data. At the end of each epoch, the average loss values are calculated and displayed. Finally, the trained generator creates a batch of images, which are then visualized. This code effectively demonstrates the GAN training process, leading to the generator producing progressively more authentic images and the discriminator becoming better at distinguishing between genuine and synthetic images.
